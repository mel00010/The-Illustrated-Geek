		\jonesspeaks:		Hey!  Christine!  Come check out this weird rock!
		\morrisonspeaks:	Coming.  What is it Harry?
		\jonesspeaks:		I don't know.  Shit!  That's sharp.  It poked a hole in my glove! I think it cut my finger,
		too.
		\ramseyspeaks:		Dammit Harry!  You know that we only have so many of these suits, right?  Head back to base.
		Alice, you go with him.  Everyone else, continue gathering samples.
		\jonesspeaks:		Roger that, Commander.  Heading back to base.
		\lewisspeaks:		Got it Paul.  I'll accompany him and patch him up.

		\lewisspeaks:		How the hell did you cut yourself up that bad, Harry?  This cut is deep.  
		\jonesspeaks:		I don't know, Alice.  I just picked up that rock, and next thing I know my glove is punctured
		and my finger is cut.  
		\lewisspeaks:		The cut's all sandy.  I'm gonna need to wash it out.  This will sting a bit.  
		\jonesspeaks:		Aghh!
		\lewisspeaks:		Sorry.  I'm gonna bandage it up now.  Try not to do this again, please?
		\jonesspeaks:		I'll try.

	Today was a interesting day.  After a long morning of collecting samples to look for
	potential life in the soil, Harry picked up a strangely organic-looking rock and somehow managed to cut
	through his glove and into his finger.  I didn't even know that was possible.  I will have to check back periodically on his
	finger as it heals.

		\jonesspeaks:		Alice, I'm not feeling so well.  My head is killing me, my finger is sending stabbing pains
		down my arms, and I feel super nauseous.
		\lewisspeaks:		Oh my God your face!  You're deathly pale!  Come over here quickly!  You've got an insane
		fever!  
		\ramseyspeaks:		It must be from the cut on his finger.  He's infected.  We can't take any risks.  Harry,
		we're going to have to put you in quarantine.
